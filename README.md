        <h7 class="text-yellow"> Recommended by </h7>Dana from the <a href="https://bellocollective.com/"></h7>Bello Collective</a>. <br>
        <h7 class="text-yellow"> She says,</h7> <i> "Ghosts in the Burbs. To some, October means sweaters, PSLs, and football. To me, October means sweaters, Reese’s pumpkins, and horror podcasts. My first horror binge of the season went to Ghosts in the Burbs. The subdued, slow, and realistic feel of the ongoing story was both exactly what I wanted in my listening binge and also a huge mistake which led me to locking myself in the bathroom to hang out in a safe space until my husband came home. Starting as a blog, the podcast series is read by Liz Sauer, a writer and children’s librarian in Wellesley, Massachusetts who sets out to naively just collect ghost stories of the town … without becoming a paranormal target herself." <br>
<h7 class="text-yellow"> We say, </h7> "The genius of this podcast is in its simplicity - a first-person narrative with some added sound FX. Boo!" <br></i>
        <h7 class="text-yellow">Description:</h7> Ghosts In The Burbs is a podcast about the ghosties living in Wellesley, Massachusetts and the suburbanites who encounter them.

        <h7 class="text-yellow"> He says,</h7> <i> "Make no mistake, The Decision is not sports radio. Even though the central premise is about passionate fandom, there is an absence of bluster. Instead the program consists largely of easy going, often erudite conversations, touching as much on the Instagram accounts of players as their history and playing style. Guests run the gamut, including podcasters, journalists, comedians, filmmakers and kind of everywhere in between. It’s this everyman take that positions the show to also serve as an entree into the sport for the uninitiated." <br>
<h7 class="text-yellow"> We say, </h7> "The concept is a little hard to take in being a soccer/football fan based in the UK - the thought of changing one's team is unthinkable - however, this is an intriguing mini-series nevertheless. Nicely produced and food-for-thought for those who watch basketball occasionally but are not yet affiliated with a team. Swish!" <br></i>
        <h7 class="text-yellow">Description:</h7> This is The Decision: The podcast where people try to convince host Alex Kapelman to finally abandon The Knicks, and become a fan of their favorite team. The Decision is produced by Alex Kapelman. Original music from Louis Stein, Alessio Romano, and Scott Kapelman. There will be five new episodes of the show every weekday until Tuesday, October 17, when the final episode will be released.

        <h7 class="text-yellow"> They say,</h7> <i> "This hard-to-define indie podcast is a thing of spectacular ambition and ravenous curiosity, presenting deeply-reported episodes that seek to understand what it means to be American. Host and producer Najib Aminy is a journalist by trade, and it shows. Pounding the pavement from mosques to wrestling rings, he is equipped with the tools of a reporter: a nose for a story, an easy rapport with people, an instinct for when to speak and when to be quiet. Interviews and actuality are cut with archival audio and Aminy's reserved narration, and though episodes are long, they aren't formless. They unfold deliberately and one must absorb them patiently (a healthy prescription for restless podcast reviewers). " <br>
<h7 class="text-yellow"> We say, </h7> "Sometime the presenter alone makes the piece worth listening to, and this is very mucht he case here. Well worth a binge." <br></i>
        <h7 class="text-yellow">Description:</h7> It's a show about stories and the foolish pursuit of life, clarity and context. Stories that confront, challenge and question our preconceived notions of Uncle Sam’s culture, tradition and identity. And stories that focus on the purpose of common folk—be it those who spend their Fridays in a wrestling ring or those that attend Sunday service, and ask why?

Deadly Manners was created by Ali Garfinkel and Alex Aldea.

CBC dropped the whole 10-episode series last week, and we tipped headlong into it, following Parise from the first flush of her relationship with the man who would become her husband, through the pleasures and difficulties of marriage, into the painful present. <br> It's obviously extremely personal, and there is a wildness in Parise's descriptions of her own pain that makes us think it isn't entirely in the past. At times, it's uncomfortable, spilling over with the embarrassing self-regard of a journal. But discomfort is no bad thing.<br> Mostly, it is magical: honest, deeply felt, and beautifully scored, too. Thoughtful story editing by Veronica Simmonds, of Sleepover, Braidio and other good things." <br>
